    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I moved to Truckee at 18 years old and never looked back. My first Web client was in 2010, helping West Shore Cafe’.</p>
    <p> I enjoy creating professional, user friendly, mobile responsive and SEO ready websites for clients. When not behind the computer screen I can be found in the Backcountry, hiking, fishing, Search and Rescue or working on the farm.</p>
